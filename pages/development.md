Everything development related here!

## Languages

Languages which I consider myself proficient enough in that I can parse, understand, and write an application in today with little learning required.

| Language      | Note |
| ---           | ---- |
| CSS           | |
| C#            | 2+ years professional development experience.                                                     |
| GraphQL       | Alternative to REST API development. Kind of a weird concept still, and quite verbose, but fun.   |
| HTML          | |
| Java          | Haven't used Java outside of an academic context.                                                 |
| Javascript    | 2+ years professional development experience. |
| JSON          | Pretty standard. |
| Typescript    | |
| Rust          | This is a high priority to use more frequently. |
| PHP           | macOS ships with PHP. |
| YAML          | Succinct alternate to JSON if I ever need it. Used with Hexo.                                     |

## Environments

| Environment   | Note |
| ------------- | --- |
| Node.js       | |

## Frameworkss & Tools

Frameworks built on top of languages that I have used before.

| Framework     | Note |
| ------------- | --- |
| Laravel       ||
| Express.js    | |
| Angular.js    | |
| Angular       | Rather complicated, but acts as an entire environment. No need to grab other components to build a mishmash of features. |
| Knockout.js   | Eh, kind of a prototypical framework which has been replaced by Vue, et al. |
| Vue.js        | Sometimes Angular is just so complicated, man. |
| Hexo          | Static site generator. |
| ASP.NET       | Used frequently at past employment, to pick back up with small side projects. |

## Databases & Stores

Databases & stores I am comfortable with, and have a grasp on their functionality.

| Databases & Stores | Note |
| ------------- | --- |
| MySQL         | Default choice for a relational database if I need it. |
| MSSQL         | Used in professional environments only, never as a hobby. Tedious driver on Node.js is good. |
| Redis         | Good as a simple document store in addition to a key-value store and cache. |
| RethinkDB     | Nice, elegant, document store. |
| ElasticSearch | Anything search oriented I tend to use ElasticSearch due to its ability to score items. |
| PostgreSQL    | |

## Package Managers

Package Managers that I like and have used before!

| Package Manager | Note |
| --- | --- |
| NPM | Should use infrequently where possible. |
| Yarn | Use this preferentially to NPM now. |

## Tools & Packages

Tools and packages that make development easier.

| Tools & Packages | Note |
| --------- | --- |
| Gulp      | I prefer Gulp for simpler projects. |
| PostCSS   | Consider alongside SASS. |
| socket.io | |
| Sass      | Should be considered alongside PostCSS. |
| Webpack   | |

## Web Servers

I recognize that many of the entities listed above qualify as webservers.

| Web Server | Note |
| ---------- | --- |
| Nginx | |
