Applications that I endorse and use on desktop & mobile. Ultimate goal is to use as few non-native applications as possible in an attempt to reduce system bloat as well as keeping operational maintenance to a minimum.

Applications are tagged with the following characteristics to indicate aspects of their use & integration into my lifestyle:

* **Infrequent**. May be downloaded on-demand when needed.
* **GUI**. Downloaded from an external source via GUI.
* **Mac App Store**. Downloaded directly from the Mac App Store via `mas`.
* **Legacy**. Investigate a replacement soon.
* **Brew/Brew Cask**. GUI application that was installed via brew. Preferred.

This document is also subsequently broken down into macOS, macOS CLI, and iOS applications.

# iOS

General goal is to have no more than approximately a single page of third party apps. A web browser suffices most of the time. The third page is relegated to infrequently used apps.
